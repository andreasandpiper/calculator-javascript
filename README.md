### About
> The calculator was a student project at Learning Fuze to practice jQuery, writing functions, and logic problems. I used an agile approach to this project by first incorporating basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. I create an object for each input which is stored in an array in the Calculator object. When the user click the equal sign, the array of objects is first passed through a filter function to remove any outlier operands. Then the filtered array is passed through a function to perform order of operations. I used an array of operand symbols to achieve this. My future goals for this project is to convert this to React MVC.
